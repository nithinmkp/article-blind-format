	abstract = {We use a large household survey that is being conducted by the Reserve Bank of India since 2005 to estimate the dynamics of aggregate inflation expectations over a volatile inflation regime. A simple average of the quantitative responses produces biased estimates of the official inflation data. We therefore estimate expectations by quantifying the reported directional responses. We perform quantification by using the hierarchical ordered probit model, in addition to the balance statistic. We find that the quantified expectations from qualitative forecasts track the actual inflation rate better than the averages of the quantitative forecasts, highlighting the filtering role of qualitative tendency surveys. We also report estimates of the disagreement among households. The proposed approach is particularly suitable in emerging economies, where inflation tends to be high and volatile.},

	abstract = {We study the role of consumer conﬁdence in forecasting real personal consumption expenditure, and contribute to the extant literature in three substantive ways. First, we re-examine existing empirical models of consumption and consumer conﬁdence, not only at the quarterly frequency, but using monthly data as well. Second, we employ real-time data in addition to commonly used revised vintages. Third, we investigate the role of consumer conﬁdence in a rich information context. We produce forecasts of consumption expenditures with and without consumer conﬁdence measures using a dynamic factor model and a large, real-time, jagged-edge dataset. In a robust way, we establish the important role of conﬁdence surveys in improving the accuracy of consumption forecasts, manifesting primarily through the services component. During the recession of 2007–2009, sentiment is found to have a more pervasive effect on all components of aggregate consumption: durables, non-durables and services.

	abstract = {We study the information content of the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment as well as its ﬁve components. Using household data from the Surveys of Consumers over 1979-2013, we identify the main determinants of these indicators and document their varying role over the business cycle. Our results suggest that while at the aggregate level, macroeconomic conditions explain sentiment well, important and additional information is contained at the level of households. We compare the role of objective and subjective information in determining household level sentiment, and show that signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the absorption of news from local network sources is a major feature of consumer sentiment. The differential interpretation of current macroeconomic conditions is found to be more pervasive in periods of falling sentiment that typically predates business cycle peaks, and thus helps sentiment to foreshadow recessions.},

 abstract = {Using UK data the REPIH is rejected due to the predictive content of consumer confidence, and not labour income or any other macroeconomic variable. We provide evidence suggesting that this cannot be explained by liquidity constraints and account for this finding in terms of precautionary saving. Extending the CCAPM model to allow a time varying conditional variance we find a high level of confidence is associated with greater optimism about the level of consumption but also a higher forecast variance. Allowing for time aggregation, the overidentifying restrictions implied by this model are accepted. We estimate a small but statistically significant intertemporal elasticity of substitution.},

 abstract = {Optimization of the part of consumers is shown to imply that the marginal utility of consumption evolves according to a random walk with trend. To a reasonable approximation, consumption itself should evolve in the same way. In particular, no variable apart from current consumption should be of any value in predicting future consumption. This implication is tested with time-series data for the postwar United States. It is confirmed for real disposable income, which has no predictive power for consumption, but rejected for an index of stock prices. The paper concludes that the evidence supports a modified version of the life cycle--permanent income hypothesis.},

abstract = {This study examines the channels of transmission of unanticipated energy price changes and monetary policy shocks to household consumption decisions. We use a large and dynamic panel data set of Indian households for the analysis. Our findings show that both shocks have adverse effects on aggregate consumption and its categories. Furthermore, rising energy prices and monetary tightening policies disproportionately affect the relatively elastic components of household spending, such as various services, rather than the relatively inelastic demand, such as fuel and food. We also find that consumption of durable goods is more susceptible to these shocks than non-durables owing to higher operating costs. Nevertheless, our findings show a positive interaction effect of monetary and energy shocks on household spending. Both shocks together are perceived as an indication of a booming economy, along with an effort from monetary authorities to safeguard against unanticipated inflation, which in turn boosts household confidence in the fast-growing economy. Additionally, we also examine the effects of these shocks on various indices of household sentiment to validate the presence of the sentiment channel of transmission of these shocks on spending. Lastly, using realized and conditional volatility measures, we find that the effects of these shocks on household spending are exacerbated during periods of high energy price volatility, owing to increased cautiousness effects.}}
